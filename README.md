AngelHack project (part 3 of 3)
==============================

This is one part of our AngelHack 2012 project.  The project as a whole is an iOS app that makes Passbook actually useful.  
It scans your email for tickets, parses and pdf tickets, constructs a passbook entry, and pushes it to your iOS device --
so you can use Passbook with no effort on your part.

### Part 3
This particular piece is a server based on Apple's provided code for Passbook servers.  We modified and extended it to support our use case.

Part 1 is the iOS app: https://github.com/braddgriffith/willie-mayes-hayes

Part 2 is the Rails/IMAP server:

All code is extremely hacky, written in 24 hours with no sleep and way too much caffeine.
